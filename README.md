A project I worked on during my time at a local research lab internship. My goal was to accelerate my understanding of neural networks, and having a strong fundamental baseline for working on tools like PyTorch, Keras, or TensorFlow. You will find much of the code and comments for my first ever iteration abstract and unclear. I believe not quite a reflection of what Im capable of, Ive added a revision with slight improvements.

The whole idea is having a my simple neural network
