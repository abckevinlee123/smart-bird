# smart-bird

A project I worked on during my time at a research lab. My goal was to accelerate my understanding of neural networks, and having a strong fundamental baseline for working on tools like PyTorch, Keras, or TensorFlow. You will find much of the code and comments abstract and unclear, and so I've added a revist where I have made a more interactive platform for adjust the neural network.
